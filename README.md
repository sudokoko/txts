# Txts

*A faithful recreation of the txti.es service in ASP.NET*

## What is Txts?

Txts allows users to create markdown-based simple web pages. Most of the world still does not have internet, but many
websites from countries like the United States are big and complicated. This makes it hard for people with slow internet
to use these sites. It is even harder for those people to put their own thoughts on the internet. With Txts, anyone can
use any device to share their story.
